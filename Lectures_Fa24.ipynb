We will practice a lot!\n","\n","Research in psychology has shown that people with a “growth mindset” — the concept that a person’s ability and intelligence are not fixed but can be cultivated — are more likely to get better and achieve more.   The growth mindset is particularly crucial for programming because it is a skill we gain through hard work and lots of trial and error.  The more time you spend practicing, the better you will get!\n","\n","### Course objectives:\n","You will learn good programming practices and will be able to continue learning on your own.\n","You will learn commonly used algorithms in computational physics and apply them to physics problems.\n","You will learn to validate your numerical results.  How do you know that your code is giving a sensible answer, and how big is the numerical error?\n","\n","### Lectures:\n","In the lectures, we will cover both theories and programming exercises.  Therefore, please bring (1) a notebook for taking class notes and (2) your laptop for coding exercises.\n","\n","### Homework:\n","Homework assignments are announced each Thursday and are due the following Friday.  Please submit a Jupyter Notebook to Canvas.  \n","\n","Late penalty: -1 point if one day late, -2 points if two days late, etc.  You are strongly encouraged to work with your classmates, but please write your own code.\n","\n","### Labs:\n","Please bring your laptop.  During a lab session, you will work in a team of 2 or 3.  Each person will submit a Jupyter Notebook on Canvas.  Please sign out with the me before you leave.  You are encouraged to work on your homework during lab sessions.\n","\n","Every lab counts.  If you have to miss a lab, let me know in advance, and you can submit the make-up lab before the following Friday with no penalty.  You can do up to 2 make-up labs.\n","\n","### Exams:\n","There will be three exams on weeks 5, 9, and 13 (Friday lab time).  The exams will be in pencil-paper format, and you can bring a 1-page note sheet.\n","\n","### Final project:\n","You will form a team of 3 to work on a project related to scientific computing.  You will submit a project proposal on week 10, and in the subsequent weeks, you will submit updates to your project (called checkpoints).  The proposal and checkpoints count into grades.\n","In the last week of class, your team will give a \\~10 slide oral presentation (\\~10 minutes).\n","\n","### Preliminary letter grade schema:\n","\n","≥ 88% some form of A\n","\n","76-87% some form of B\n","\n","64-75% some form of C\n","\n","50-63% some form of D\n","\n","< 50% F\n","\n","### Grading:\n","\n","Labs: 10x15=150 (15%)\n","\n","Homework: 10x25=250 (25%)\n","\n","Three exams: 3x150=450 (45%)\n","\n","Final project: 1x150 (15%)\n","\n","Total: 1000 pts\n","\n","Note: The textbook is optional.
